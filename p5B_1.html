	<strong>W3TechBlog</strong> is a community of people for learning, testing, and training. The main goal of this community is to collaborate and work for WWW.W3TechBlog community believes in simplicity.<br> The tutorial given here starts from basic level and move all the way up to professional references. W3TechBlog presents hundreds of code examples and video tutorials. <br>We have taken utmost care to keep this code up to date. Main goal of this community is to deliver Simply Easy Learning with wide range of technical and non-technical subjects. <br>W3TechBlog community was started on 17 July 2020.
	The blog focuses on the business aspects of big data and how to make data science work for organizations. It also features information about trending tech topics like blockchain and artificial intelligence. While it largely acts as a resource with articles and insights, Datafloq also seeks to connect professionals via job postings, vendors, events, and training.
<em>Best Data Science</em> Blogs to Follow The internet is filled with dozens of articles, newsletters, white papers, and reports about research and in-depth analysis of these trends. We have listed some of the top resources and portals online, that are frequently updated and comprehensively cover everything Data Science.

	Well, normally the name Artificial Intelligence suggests the Intelligence of a machine which is artificial. The intelligence posses by human is known as human intelligence, like in the same way the intelligence demonstrated by a machine is known as Artificial Intelligence. In computer science. Artificial intelligence(AI), sometimes called machine intelligence. The research field of Artificial Intelligence was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.
	The chatbots like SIRI, CORTANA which have gained so much of popularity in nowadays. Other examples like EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant), an AI-based chatbot developed by HDFC banks’s AI research department which can collect knowledge from thousands of sources and provide simple answers in less than 0.4 seconds. There are so many examples of AI applications you will find in different field of our society.
	Researchers of Standford University, Computer Science Department has introduced this domain of AI and it is a prominent research domain of AI. It is a computer application which can solve most complex problems of any specific domain. It is considered at the highest level of human Intelligence and expertise as it is based on knowledge acquired from an expert. Expert System can also be defined as computer-based decision making system that can solve complex decision-making problems using both facts and heuristics.

	The knowledge base is a container of high quality knowledge. Skills develop through practice and intelligence comes from knowledge without knowledge one cannot proof or one cannot show his or her intelligence, so knowledge is very important to develop skill and to exhibit intelligence. Like, in the same way knowledge is required for machine also to exhibit its intelligence. The accuracy of prediction and also the performance of the system is highly and majorly dependent on the collection of perfect, accurate and precise knowledge. 
	Knowledge is data or information. For us human being by reading articles and by reading books or from different resources we used to gather knowledge if we can see the process of gaining and enriching knowledge minutly then we will find that by reading books or by reading articles or from any resources we are fetching and extracting data and information from different sources which we then used to store in our brain. So knowledge is data, knowledge is information. Knowledge is also collection of facts.
	In Forward Chaining, the Inference Engine gives the outcome by following the chain of conditions and derivations. Whatever the knowledge is feeded in the system it goes through all those knowledges and facts and sorts them before concluding a solution. By forward chaining method, expert system tries to answers, “What can happen next?”

 Application of forward chaining: House price prediction, stock prediction, prediction of share market etc.
